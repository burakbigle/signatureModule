# SignatureModule

This project was generated with the help of [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8. The intention is to create a signature module for the clients of the Bigle Iberia SL company.

# Introduction

This document is a very small and brief version of the Software Requirements Specifications. The reference of the structure is also a small duplication of a IEEE committee guideline.

In this context of the docuemnt, we intented for other developers of the team to understand:

* what we are doing, 
* why we are doing,
* how we are doing.

# Context

Signature module is a dynamic signature platform for users to be able to sign their documents and intereact with the other signing authorities. These authorities can be a single attendees or corporates or third party contributers to the signing process.

The platform characteristics are not limited but: 

* Beautifully Designed, 
* User Friendly,
* Simple, Minimalist, Eye Catching,
* Fast enough to handle all the required operations,
* Bug Free! (yeah, sure right)
* Well Documented

## Development server

For the development server, localhost is preferred to see the changes and track the user perspective practices. 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
